- Great to see that you managed to produce an output response curve.
- Nice to see that you managed to monitor the data real-time in Python. That will indeed make tuning the controller easier.
- Nice to read that you now understand the physics of the wheel and the importance of the moment of inertia
- Please include figure next time in the weekly progress including some explanation of what we see
- Minor detail: in the code blocks you are still using the c layout. You can change that to Python to properly format the code to Python.

General recommendations:
- Place your weekly progress reports in reverse order, with the most recent week at the top.
- Do not be afraid of Markdown. If you wish, you could start by writing a basic text file in Word and later convert it to Markdown.
- Always add annotations or description to all graphs, pictures, videos, code and data you share in your weekly progress report. Do not assume these are self-explanatory; your readers rely on your explanations to understand their relevance and importance.
- The weekly progress reports form the foundation of your final written product. The more clear, detailed, and comprehensive your reports are, the better prepared you will be to complete your final product.
