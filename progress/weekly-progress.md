# About this document

This is a team document where you record your weekly progress. It is written in Markdown, which allows you to format content in a simple and readable way. The document is rendered directly in GitHub without the need for a compiler (unlike LaTeX). The syntax is relatively easy. An overview of commonly used Markdown syntax can be found here:  
https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/

Below you find an example of the sections that must be included in each weekly progress report.

Use the **same document for all weeks**. For each week, use the **same headers and subheaders**.

Use the GitHub repository to store important project files (code, visuals including videos and figures, data, etc.). If necessary refer to those files in this document using a hyperlink.

# Week 1

## 1. Progress description
Describe the progress of your work for this week. Keep it clear and concise.

## 2. Code

You can display code using three backticks (```) followed by an optional language extension.  
For example:  
- For C/C++ code, use `c` or `cpp`.  
- For Python, use `python`.


#### Example:

```c
// Header file for input/output functions
#include <stdio.h>

// Main function: entry point for execution
int main() {

    // Print a message to the console
    printf("Hello World");

    return 0;
}
``` 
## 3. Results
Present your results here. This may include tables, figures, or charts.
Add charts and other visuals to the `visuals` folder in the GitHub repository and reference them in this document if needed.


## 4. Reflection

What should you focus on or improve in the coming weeks of the project?
